# Airflow_tutorial

Nothing super fantastic, just me trying to learn and potentially teach airflow

Started of by learning what Airflow is and just basic understanding

Next, went off to learn more, i.e setting up airflow in python_env, setting up in docker(commonly used)
Ran into few errors along the way but it sure was fun. Now join me as I tackle and learn more, along side excersise from my bro ChatyGpty

yaaaaaayyyyyyyyy boiiiiiiii
